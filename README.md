# LearnMarten
My attempt at trying to make sense of Marten

SpikeMarten is a WebAPI Project, which exposes API calls that are used to issue commands, and source events.

Blazor Project is intended to show the consumption of those events using the Marten Async Daemon, and update the UI (using signalR, to come later).
